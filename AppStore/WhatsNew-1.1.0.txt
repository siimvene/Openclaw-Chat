Image Sharing
Send photos directly in chat — capture with your camera or pick from your library. The AI can analyze, describe, and discuss your images.

Share Extension
Share content to ClawChat from any app. Found something interesting in Safari or Photos? Tap Share → ClawChat and it goes straight to your conversation.

Improved Reliability
Fixed a bug where the app would repeatedly reconnect during device pairing. Connection errors are now shown in chat instead of disappearing silently.

Requirements
This update requires OpenClaw gateway 2026.2.17 or later. Update your gateway before upgrading the app.
