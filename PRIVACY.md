# Privacy Policy for OpenClaw Chat

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

OpenClaw Chat ("the App") is a mobile client that connects to your self-hosted OpenClaw gateway. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## What Data We Collect

The App itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us or third parties.

All data entered in the App (messages, voice input, credentials) is:
- Stored locally on your device
- Transmitted directly to YOUR OpenClaw gateway
- Never sent to our servers

## Data Stored on Your Device

- Gateway URL and authentication token (stored in iOS App Storage)
- Chat session history (stored locally)
- App preferences and settings

## Data Transmitted

When you use the App, your messages and voice input are sent directly to your configured OpenClaw gateway over an encrypted connection (TLS/WSS). We have no access to this communication.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses Apple's on-device Speech framework. No audio data leaves your device.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses Apple's on-device AVSpeechSynthesizer. No audio data leaves your device.

## Data Retention

All data is stored on your device and your gateway. Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data. Data on your gateway is managed by you.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted in this repository.
